# Scraper Stability & Error Handling Improvements

## Date: October 22, 2025

## Problem Summary

The scraper was experiencing critical browser context stability issues:
- ✅ **First business**: Extracted successfully
- ❌ **Subsequent businesses**: All failed with "Target page, context or browser has been closed"
- ❌ **Root cause**: Website contact extraction was interfering with the main browser context

## Critical Error Log

```
Going back to search results...
❌ Error processing business 1: Page.go_back: Target page, context or browser has been closed
❌ Error processing business 2: Locator.click: Target page, context or browser has been closed
[...9 more failures...]
Result: Only 1 out of 10 businesses scraped
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Disabled Website Contact Extraction**

**Problem**: The `enhance_with_website_contacts()` method was creating a separate Playwright browser instance that interfered with the main scraping context.

**Solution**: 
```python
# OLD CODE (Lambda-only check)
if is_lambda:
    print("  ℹ️ Skipping website extraction in Lambda environment")
    enhanced_data = business_data
else:
    enhanced_data = await self.enhance_with_website_contacts(business_data, browser)

# NEW CODE (Always disabled during multi-business scraping)
print("  ℹ️ Skipping website extraction to maintain browser stability")
enhanced_data = business_data
```

**Rationale**: 
- Website extraction creates a separate browser context that can close the main page
- Google Maps data already provides: name, phone, website, address, Instagram, WhatsApp
- Email extraction from websites is the only missing piece, but not critical
- Stability > completeness when scraping multiple businesses

---

### 2. **Enhanced Browser Fingerprinting**

**Problem**: Basic user agent and headers might trigger bot detection.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive browser fingerprint configuration:

```python
context = await browser.new_context(
    viewport=self.viewport,
    user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
    locale='es-AR',  # Argentine Spanish
    timezone_id='America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires',
    permissions=['geolocation'],
    geolocation={'latitude': -34.6037, 'longitude': -58.3816},  # Buenos Aires
    extra_http_headers={
        'Accept-Language': 'es-AR,es;q=0.9,en;q=0.8',
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*',
        'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
        'Sec-Ch-Ua': '"Chromium";v="131", "Not_A Brand";v="24"',
        'Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile': '?0',
        'Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform': '"Windows"',
        'Sec-Fetch-Dest': 'document',
        'Sec-Fetch-Mode': 'navigate',
        'Sec-Fetch-Site': 'none',
        'Sec-Fetch-User': '?1',
        'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests': '1'
    }
)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ More realistic browser fingerprint
- ✅ Locale matches search region (Argentina)
- ✅ Geolocation provides Buenos Aires coordinates
- ✅ Modern Chrome headers (v131)
- ✅ Proper Sec-Fetch-* headers

### 3. **Page Validity Checking Before Navigation**

**Problem**: Trying to call `page.go_back()` on a closed page causes crashes.

**Solution**: Check page status before navigation:

```python
# Go back to search results - check if page is still valid first
if i < len(business_links) - 1:
    print("Going back to search results...")
    try:
        # Check if page/context is still valid
        if page.is_closed():
            print("⚠️ Page was closed, cannot go back")
            raise Exception("Page closed")
        
        await page.go_back()
        await page.wait_for_timeout(3000)
        
        # Verify we're back on search results
        try:
            await page.wait_for_selector('[role="main"]', timeout=10000)
            print("✓ Back on search results page")
        except:
            print("⚠ Could not verify we're back on results page")
    except Exception as go_back_error:
        print(f"⚠️ Could not go back ({go_back_error}), re-navigating to search...")
        # Re-navigate to search results as fallback
        try:
            await page.goto(f"https://www.google.com/maps/search/{query.replace(' ', '+')}")
            await page.wait_for_timeout(3000)
            await page.wait_for_selector('[role="main"]', timeout=10000)
            print("✓ Re-navigated to search results")
        except Exception as nav_error:
            print(f"❌ Failed to re-navigate: {nav_error}")
            raise
```

**Flow**:
1. Check if page is closed
2. Try `go_back()` 
3. If fails, re-navigate to search URL
4. If that fails too, raise exception and exit gracefully

---

### 4. **Improved Error Recovery**

**Problem**: One error would cascade through all remaining businesses.

**Solution**: Intelligent error recovery with graceful degradation:

```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"  ❌ Error processing business {i+1}: {e}")
    
    # Take screenshot only if page is still valid
    if not self._is_lambda_environment():
        try:
            if not page.is_closed():
                await page.screenshot(path=f"debug_error_business_{i+1}.png")
        except:
            pass
    
    # Try to recover
    try:
        if i < len(business_links) - 1:
            print("Attempting to recover...")
            
            # Check if page is closed - if so, exit gracefully
            if page.is_closed():
                print("⚠️ Page is closed, cannot continue scraping")
                break
            
            # Try go_back, then re-navigate if needed
            try:
                await page.go_back(timeout=5000)
            except:
                await page.goto(f"https://www.google.com/maps/search/{query.replace(' ', '+')}", timeout=10000)
    except Exception as recovery_error:
        print(f"❌ Recovery failed: {recovery_error}")
        break  # Exit gracefully instead of cascading errors
```

**Recovery Strategy**:
1. ✅ Check page status
2. ✅ Try screenshot (if possible)
3. ✅ Attempt go_back
4. ✅ Fallback to re-navigate
5. ✅ Break loop if unrecoverable

### 5. **Enhanced WhatsApp Extraction** (From Earlier Update)

**New selectors** to find WhatsApp in action buttons:
```python
whatsapp_selectors = [
    # Direct links
    'a[href*="wa.me"]',
    'a[href*="whatsapp"]',
    'a[href*="api.whatsapp.com"]',
    # Buttons
    'button:has-text("WhatsApp")',
    'a[aria-label*="WhatsApp"]',
    # Reserve/Order buttons
    'button[data-item-id*="reserve"] a[href*="wa.me"]',
    'button[data-item-id*="order"] a[href*="wa.me"]',
    '[data-item-id*="action"] a[href*="wa.me"]',
    'button a[href*="wa.me"]',
    '[role="button"] a[href*="wa.me"]',
    # Catch-all
    '*[href*="wa.me"]',
]
```

**Enhanced phone extraction** from WhatsApp URLs:
```python
def _extract_phone_from_whatsapp_url(self, url):
    # URL decode
    url = unquote(url)
    
    # Multiple regex patterns
    patterns = [
        r'https?://api\.whatsapp\.com/send[/?]*\??(?:.*[?&])?phone=(\+?[\d]+)',
        r'https?://wa\.me/(\+?[\d]+)',
        r'[?&]phone=(\+?[\d]+)',
        r'phone[=:](\+?[\d]+)'
    ]
    
    # Validate length (10-15 digits)
    if 10 <= len(phone.replace('+', '')) <= 15:
        return phone
```

---

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. ✅ Deploy these fixes immediately
2. ✅ Monitor scraping success rates
3. ⚠️ Consider: Add email extraction as a separate post-processing step

### Long Term
1. **Email Extraction**: Create a separate Lambda function that:
   - Queries businesses without emails from MongoDB
   - Runs website extraction in isolation
   - Updates records with emails
   - Doesn't interfere with main scraping

2. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between businesses to appear more human-like

3. **Proxy Rotation**: Consider using residential proxies for large-scale scraping
